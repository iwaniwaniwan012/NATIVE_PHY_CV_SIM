# NATIVE_PHY_CV_SIM
Project for simulation NATIVE PHY IP Core with dynamic reconfiguration speed change Simulation Software - ModelSim (fast) or ModelSim Altera Edition (more slowly)

Do next steps to test simulation
    Download project
    Launch ModelSim
    cd "Path to project"
    do ./scripts/setup.tcl

Enjoy simulation =)

Note: if you don`t want to simulate, you can open TB_NATIVE_PHY_SIM.wlf file to see all simulation results.
